# ocicat

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix-incubator/ocicat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wix-incubator/ocicat)

ocicat is a purely functional [throttler and rate limiter](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/api-manager/throttling-and-rate-limiting.html)

## Installing

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.wix" %% "ocicat" % "0.0.1"
```

## Getting Started

### Throttler

Throttler allows you to throttle requests concurrently with rate you specify.

- decide about throttling rate. For example up to 5 calls in one minute.
```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import com.wix.ocicat.Rate._

val rate = 5 every 1.minute
```

- create a throttler for any container that has cats.effect.Sync instance, e.g. cats.effect.IO.
String is a type of Key we are going throttle on.
```scala
val throttler = Throttler[IO, Int](limit every window.millis,  InMemoryStorage[IO, Int](Clock.create)).unsafeRunSync()
```

- submit a key to the throttle on action you want to be throttled
```scala
val key = UUID.randomUUID().toString
throttler.throttle(key).unsafeRunSync()
throttler.throttle(key).unsafeRunSync()
throttler.throttle(key).unsafeRunSync()
throttler.throttle(key).unsafeRunSync()
throttler.throttle(key).unsafeRunSync()

throttler.throttle(key).unsafeRunSync() // going to throw ThrottleException because of exceeding throttle limits.
```


- in case you are working with future (sic!), use this snippet for the throttler creation
```scala
    def futureThrottler[A](rate: Rate) = {
      new Throttler[Future, A] {
        val throttler0 = Throttler.unsafeCreate[IO, A](rate)
        override def throttle(key: A) = throttler0.throttle(key).unsafeToFuture()
      }
    }
```
- throttler comes with in memory storage. In memory throttler is good for throttling in scope of one jvm. 
For distributed cases  there is redis throttler storage implementation. Redis throttler storage is capable to throttle only string keys.  
```scala
case class MyKey(key: String)
val storage: RedisStorage[IO] = RedisStorage[IO](s"redis://localhost:9000", clock)
val stringThrottler: Throttler[IO, String] = Throttler[IO, String](limit every window.millis,  storage).unsafeRunSync()
val myKeyThrottler: Throttler[IO, MyKey] = stringThrottler.contramap[MyKey](_.key)
```   

### Rate limiter

Rate limiter allows you to execute tasks making sure that specified rate is not exceeded.

- decide about the rate and the queue size. For example up to 5 calls in one minute.
```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import com.wix.ocicat.Rate._

val rate = 5 every 1.minute
val maxPending = Long.MaxValue
```

- create a rate limiter for any container that has cats.effect.Concurrent instance, e.g. cats.effect.IO.
```scala
val rateLimiter = RateLimiter[IO](rate, maxPending, Clock.create).unsafeRunSync()
```

- you can either submit tasks to be executed asynchronously or await task execution
```scala
val task = IO("This is a task for a rate limiter!")

val submitResult: IO[Unit] = rateLimiter.submit(task)
val taskResult: IO[String] = rateLimiter.await(task)
```

- rate limiter will immediately fail task with **TooManyPendingTasksException** if maximum amount of pending tasks is reached

### Circuit breaker

Circuit breaker allows you to prevent failures from constantly occurring during temporary system issues.

- pick **maxFailures** (amount of errors after which circuit breaker will immediately fail tasks) and **resetTimeout** (amount of time after which circuit breaker will allow one task to go through to test the system)
```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val maxFailures = 1
val resetTimeout = 1.minute
```

- create a circuit breaker for any container that has cats.effect.Sync instance, e.g. cats.effect.IO.
```scala
val circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker[IO](maxFailures, resetTimeout, Clock.create).unsafeRunSync()
```

- circuit breaker will start to protect tasks after **maxFailures** amount of failures
```scala
val failingTask = IO.raiseError(new RuntimeException("Something went terribly wrong"))
val succeedingTask = IO.pure("I'm a happy ???")

circuitBreaker.protect(failingTask).attempt.unsafeRunSync()//Left(RuntimeException("Something went terribly wrong")
circuitBreaker.protect(succeedingTask).attempt.unsafeRunSync()//Left(RejectedException)
Thread.sleep(1000*60)
circuitBreaker.protect(succeedingTask).attempt.unsafeRunSync()//Right("I'm a happy ???")
```

- rate limiter will immediately fail task with **TooManyPendingTasksException** if maximum amount of pending tasks is reached

## Running the tests
